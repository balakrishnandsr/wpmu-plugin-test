 ##Question : how to reduce npm build file size for the plugin?

  Answer: we have to use webpack and a few modules to minify js and CSS. Plus use tree shaking methods to remove dead codes in JS and CSS. The final option to minimize the bundle size involves utilizing the Webpack Bundle Analyzer plugin. By examining the block image generated by the bundle analyzer, decisions can be made based on the context depicted in the image.

 ##Question : Prevent conflicts associated with using common composer packages in WordPress?

Answer: Follow Semantic Versioning principles for the packages. Clearly communicate changes through version numbers (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) and ensure that updates are backward-compatible whenever possible.  There is no dependency management concept in WP and it was the same case before Composer had even existed.  We will try to include the package in our plugin/theme pages with some conditional check to reduce the conflicts.
